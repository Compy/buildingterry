Building Terry mobile application for MIT program project at UGA.


### Introduction
This project is intent to develop a mobile application for the Building Terry campaign: http://building.terry.uga.edu/
Besides offer information about the campaign, the app will provide features to attract donators. One of the main features will be provide the users to interact with a virtual model of the building.

To archive our goal we started evaluating some of the solutions available to incorporate virtual elements of Augmented Reality to our project. The following document aims to instruct about how to reproduce the development environment used  and explore the source code available in this repository. 
All the code generated within this project and part of the tools needed are opensource. The other tools that requires a license can be used free of charge for our purpose.

The goal of this tutorial is not to teach about concepts of Computer Graphics or Virtual Reality, but instruct people how to reproduce the development environment used in the project. You don't need to be advanced in Computer Science to follow this tutorial, however it helps to know some theory. Throughout  this document there will be links that will point you to the theory behind some principies. 

We encorage people to use and try!


### How to Install
The main platform used in this project is an IDE called Unity3d. It is very popular in game development for providing a set of tools that allows developers to quickly deploy virtual environments. In our case we will use Unity3d to model the virtual building and other objecs that will interact with the user. Besides the fact of Unity3d be one of the best IDE for this type of development, it's cross platform and multiportable; which means that can be developed in different Operational Systems (Windows, Mac, Linux,...) and run in several different devices (Android, iOS, webBrowser, Xbox, Wii...). 
Therefore, the first step in preparing the development environment is to download and install Unity 3D:
